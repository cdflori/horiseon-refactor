# horiseon-refactor

## Changes

I had a great time working on the Horiseon Refactor project. Horieson had a great landing page for their clients and although it may look the same, what you will find is a more accessible front end design, with a more consolidated and clean back end code structure.

The following are changes you will see to your index.html and style.css sheets.

### index.html

    The biggest changes were in the structure of your HTML element. Within the body you will find three main sections "nav, main, and aside." To make sure your media elements were appropriate for SEO and accessibility needs, alt attributes were added to each element.

    To simplify your style.css sheet we created several new combined classes on like elements and deleted unessesary id's. 

    Exact changes to all line items will be listed in your index.html file in green. 


#### style.css

    The biggest changes to this sheet were to eliminate repetitve class elements and arrange the sheet in sequential order to cascade. 

    With the changes made in the index.html sheet, we used the simlified like classes to remove over 60+ lines. 

    Exact changes to all style line items will be listed in your style.css sheet in green.

##### Client Use

You will find that your site is still operating in the same fashion. Your clients will not notice any other visual changes other than alt attributes on images.
